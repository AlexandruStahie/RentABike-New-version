# RentABike-New-version

This project is the same as the old one: RentABike ASP.NET MVC app (old link: https://github.com/AlexandruStahie/RentABike-ASP.NET-MVC-App), but this time I user Bootstrap, the website is full responsive, and the authentication was made using Identity Stripped Bare. Also, I used EF for Database connection and operations. This time the app is like one page site design, and for the moment I have created only the first page with general informations like home, about us, contact, map, sign in and bicycles . Of course the admin page is also started, for the moment it is useful only for adding bicycles. Lately i would like to add Center and Orders models and methods in project and database.
